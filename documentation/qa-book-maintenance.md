# QA Book Maintenance

Add any items that need to be added to the [QA Book](https://github.com/phetsims/QA/blob/master/doc/qa-book.md) to this
markdown file.

## Small Things

- [ ] Add documentation of any useful query parameters not necessarily used in RC testing.
- [ ] Add [process for Metacog maintenance testing](https://github.com/phetsims/QA/issues/187#issue-360088338). See
[this issue](https://github.com/phetsims/QA/issues/191). Formatting doesn’t look great though, so maybe we should take
a second look there.
- [ ] Add documentation for new labeling system.
- [ ] Memory leak testing needs to be updated!

## Big Things

- [ ] Rework website translation cases for clarity.
- [ ] Rework screenshot process for clarity.
