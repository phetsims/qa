## 1: Screen Readers

### 1.1: General Bugs

* The screen reader must be turned on and reading before the browser is open for it to work. See
  https://github.com/phetsims/a11y-research/issues/90.
* The screen reader might focus the last user interface component that had focus on sim load, typically on refresh. This
  is a "feature". For example, see https://github.com/phetsims/resistance-in-a-wire/issues/139.

### 1.2: JAWS

#### 1.2.1: Firefox Bugs

* Be aware that JAWS may shift keyboard focus with Firefox Quantum. See
  https://github.com/phetsims/balloons-and-static-electricity/issues/404.
* If you use a slider by pressing and holding an arrow key, you will hear duplicate alerts that read the value when you
  release the arrow key. See https://github.com/phetsims/john-travoltage/issues/227.
* If you quickly move through slider values with arrow keys and reach the end of the range, JAWS won’t read the final
  value and it will be silent, see https://github.com/phetsims/john-travoltage/issues/246.
* When using a slider and holding down an arrow key, you might see the thumb move slowly while holding the key down,
  then move rapidly in one direction when you release a key, see https://github.com/phetsims/john-travoltage/issues/242.
* JAWS might not automatically switch to forms mode for some controls (like sliders and radio buttons). In this case,
  pressing "enter" should switch to forms mode. See https://github.com/phetsims/resistance-in-a-wire/issues/138.
* When using a slider, if value is at min/max and you press and hold an arrow key to try to move the value beyond the
  range, JAWS might crash. See https://github.com/phetsims/john-travoltage/issues/242.
* When reading about a slider with the virtual cursor, JAWS might read the min/max value with floating point rounding
  errors. For example “0.1” might sound like “0.1000...01”.
  See https://github.com/phetsims/resistance-in-a-wire/issues/177.
* If you click on the Windows taskbar (maybe other things too) pressing arrow keys will have no response from JAWS.
  Return to the browser and arrow keys should continue to work as expected.
* When focused on draggable objects, using the arrow keys will not move the object when JAWS is enabled because of
  https://github.com/phetsims/a11y-research/issues/9. WASD keys should still work.

#### 1.2.2: Chrome Bugs

* If you use a slider by pressing and holding an arrow key, you will hear duplicate alerts that read the value when you
  release the arrow key. See https://github.com/phetsims/john-travoltage/issues/227.
* When using a slider and holding down an arrow key, you might see the thumb move slowly while holding the key down,
  then move rapidly in one direction when you release a key, see https://github.com/phetsims/john-travoltage/issues/242.

### 1.3: NVDA

So empty. Much goodness.

#### 1.3.1: Firefox Bugs

* When changing screens from the Home Screen, NVDA may read the page title several times and then the first line in the new screen before the first item in the new screen. See https://github.com/phetsims/ratio-and-proportion/issues/321

### 1.4: VoiceOver

#### 1.4.1: Safari Bugs

* When closing a dialog with “escape” while the virtual cursor is on a list item, focus might not return to the Keyboard
  Help button in the navigation bar. See https://github.com/phetsims/ohms-law/issues/114.
* When using VoiceOver and the “Increment” feature on a slider (ctrl+option+spacebar), VoiceOver will sometimes read the
  previous aria-valuetext instead of the new one. See https://github.com/phetsims/a11y-research/issues/36.
* VoiceOver doesn’t interrupt alerts as aggressively as some other AT, so older alerts might queue and be read one after
  the other.
* In iOS 14, VoiceOver has a setting to describe images, which is on by default, and it is really bad at doing it for
  PhET Sims! To turn off this setting (as of 1/19/21), Settings -> Accessibility -> VoiceOver -> Verbosity -> Scene
  Descriptions -> switch off. See https://github.com/phetsims/ratio-and-proportion/issues/256 for more details.
* After a bit of use, VoiceOver may simply stop speaking alerts related to the slider value (aria-valuetext). Tabbing away
  from the component then returning to it will cause VoiceOver to speak its content again.

#### 1.4.2: Mobile Safari Bugs

* Sometimes when using VoiceOver, Safari buttons (like “reload” and “new tab” are not clickable by double tapping the
  screen. Restarting Safari fixes the problem.

## 2: Keyboard Navigation

### 2.1: General Bugs

* When using a slider, if End/Home is pressed at the same time as Home/End, the browser will treat the keypress just
  like an arrow key and the value won’t be set to max/min. See
  https://github.com/phetsims/resistance-in-a-wire/issues/163.
* When moving sliders using the keyboard navigation, you can use shift and pg up and pg down to modify the speed of the
  sliders. However, shift can be pressed at any time during the slider’s motion to slow it. Conversely, the pg up and pg
  down keys can only be pressed at the start of the slider’s motion to affect it. This difference in behavior is normal.

### 2.2: Firefox Bugs

* To get keyboard navigation to work properly in Firefox: `System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> All controls`.

### 2.3: Safari Bugs

* To get keyboard navigation to work properly in Safari:
  `Safari -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage`.
  
## 3: Voicing

### 3.1 General Bugs
* For some of the non-default Voices, it takes some time to render the information and performance of the sim may be reduced.
At this time this is acceptable and there is nothing we can do to improve this. Acceptable performance is subjective, in general
please create an issue if there are any questions about performance.

### 3.2 Chrome Bugs
* Voicing will not be muted when the tab is muted with the "Right click -> mute site" feature.
