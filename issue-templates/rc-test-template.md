<h3>Focus and Special Instructions</h3>

[Provide further instructions here. If you have any further tests you want done or specific platforms you want tested,
list them here. Any behaviors you want QA to pay special attention to should be listed here.]

<!--- [CAN BE OMITTED, SHOULD BE EDITED IF NOT OMITTED] -->
<h3>Issues to Verify</h3>

- [ ] [Issue1](link)
- [ ] [Issue2](link)
- [ ] [Issue3](link)

These issues should have the "status:ready-for-qa" label. Check these issues off and close them if they are fixed.
Otherwise, post a comment in the issue saying that it wasn't fixed and link back to this issue. If the label is
"status:ready-for-review" or "status:fixed-pending-deploy" then assign back to the developer when done, even if fixed.

<summary><b>PhET-iO RC Test</b></summary>

<!--- [DO NOT OMIT, CAN BE EDITED] -->
<h3>What to Test</h3>

- Make sure that public files do not have password protection. Use a private browser for this.
- Make sure that private files do have password protection. Use a private browser for this.
- Make sure standalone sim is working properly.
- Make sure the wrapper index is working properly.
- Make sure each wrapper is working properly.
- Launch the simulation in Studio with ?stringTest=xss and make sure the sim doesn't navigate to youtube
- For newer PhET-iO wrapper indices, save the "basic example of a functional wrapper" as a .html file and open it. Make sure the simulation loads without crashing or throwing errors.
- For an update or maintenance release please check the backwards compatibility of the playback wrapper.
[Here's the link to the previous wrapper.](link)
- Load the login wrapper just to make sure it works. Do so by adding this link from the sim deployed root: 
  ```
  /wrappers/login/?wrapper=record&validationRule=validateDigits&&numberOfDigits=5&promptText=ENTER_A_5_DIGIT_NUMBER
  ```   
  Further instructions in QA Book
- Conduct a recording test to Metacog, further instructions in the QA Book. Do this for iPadOS + Safari and one other random platform.
- Conduct a memory test on the stand alone sim wrapper (rc.1).
- Test one platform combination with `?phetioDebug` on the Studio and State wrapper.
- If Pan/Zoom is supported, make sure that it works when set with PhET-iO State.
- If filled in by issue creator, please test the diff wrapper against {{URL_TO_OLD_VERSION_ROOT}}.
- Test that the sim works offline:
  * Go to https://phet-dev.colorado.edu/html/{{sim}}/{{version}}/phet-io/{{sim}}-phet-io-{{version}}.zip
  * download it
  * unzip it to a spot locally
  * Open `index.html` by double clicking it on your desktop or in a finder-view.
  * It should look like the standalone version of the sim in PhET-iO brand.

<h3>Screen Readers</h3>

This sim supports screen readers. If you are unfamiliar with screen readers, please ask Katie to introduce you to
screen readers. If you simply need a refresher on screen readers, please consult the
[QA Book](https://github.com/phetsims/QA/blob/master/documentation/qa-book.md), which should have
all of the information you need as well as a link to a screen reader tutorial made by Jesse. Otherwise, look over the
a11y view before opening the simulation. Once you've done that, open the simulation and make sure alerts and
descriptions work as intended.

<!--- [CAN BE OMITTED, CAN BE EDITED] -->
<h3>Platforms and Screen Readers to Be Tested</h3>

- [ ] Windows 10 + Latest Chrome + Latest JAWS
- [ ] Windows 10 + Latest Firefox + Latest NVDA
- [ ] macOS + Safari + VoiceOver
- [ ] iOS + Safari + VoiceOver (only if specified in testing issue)

<!--- [CAN BE OMITTED, CAN BE EDITED] -->
<h3>Critical Screen Reader Information</h3>

We are tracking known screen reader bugs in
[this Google Document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12kTs-g-iKEIH1dyG7Q41_W_oNL4gUKbkW-IQgZjMUBw). If you find a
screen reader bug, please check it against this list.

<!--- [CAN BE OMITTED, CAN BE EDITED] -->
<h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>

This sim supports keyboard navigation. Please make sure it works as intended on all platforms by itself and with a
screen reader.

<h3>Magnification</h3>

This sim supports magnification with pinch and drag gestures on touch screens, keyboard shortcuts, and mouse/wheel controls. Please test magnfication and make sure
it is working as intended and well with the use cases of the simulation. Due to the way screen readers handle user input, magnification is NOT expected to
work while using a screen reader so there is no need to test this case.

<h3>Final Requests</h3>

- [ ] If this sim is not in [this list](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/accessibility/prototypes) or up to date there, make an
issue in [website](https://github.com/phetsims/website) to ask if PhET research page links need updating. Please assign
to @terracoda and @emily-phet.
