<h3>A Play Store update triggers simulation updates in offline contexts</h3>
</summary>

One use case for our app is offline use. The typical story here is a rural school with no internet access in the class
room. An IT support person regularly takes a teacher's classroom devices somewhere there is internet and runs play store
updates, without running the PhET App itself. In this situation the app is only opened in the absence of an internet
connection, so the online sim update system never has a chance to work. Thus, when a Play Store update happens, the app
should use the sims packaged with the app.

Testing this use case is very similar to testing a play store update (see above), except whenever the app is open the
device should be in airplane mode.

1. Uninstall the PhET Android App.
2. Visit https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4697762600441754675/ and switch to the google account you use on the
   Play Store. If there is a button called "Leave Program" then click it.
3. <a href="#clear-the-play-store-cache">Clear the Play Store cache</a>.
4. Verify the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.colorado.phet.androidApp) is offering
   the <a href="#links-and-dates">previous version</a> of the app install it.
5. Put the device in airplane mode.
6. Open the app (important!).
7. Force stop the app.
8. Take the device out of airplane mode.
9. Visit https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4697762600441754675/ and switch to the google account you use on the
   Play Store. Click Accept Invite.
10. Clear the Play Store cache.
11. Verify that the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.colorado.phet.androidApp) is offering
    an *upgrade* (not installation) to the <a href="#links-and-dates">test version</a> and click Upgrade.
12. Put the device in airplane mode.
13. Open the app again, it should have the *Sim release for testing the offline update system*
    in <a href="#links-and-dates">Links and dates</a>.
